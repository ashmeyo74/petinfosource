## Description 

This website serves as a 'hub' for the user's pets, allowing for certain information to be submitted such as their allergies, vet clinic, if they have a groomer and even their personality traits. This website serves to be a resource that someone can give out to their pet sitters, friends, family or even just to keep track of things for their pets in the future. We plan to adapt a system in the future concerning adoptable pets in your area that can be incorporated into your page, as well as reminders for vet/grooming appointments.

## Login

The login page is the first page that greets users, where they can create an account to be added to an accumilative datbase. This is where they can access all of their pets from their personal database.

## Selection & Form Entry

The next page serves as a spot for users to select if they want to enter in a new pet, or if they'd like to look into adoptable pets in their area. If the user selects the option that they already have a pet, they're taken to the form that allows them to fill in the pet's information including: Name, species, breed, vet & groomer office links, potential allergies and general notes to enter about the pet itself. 

## Results Page

After submitting the form, the user is taken to the results page, where they're given the results of their form entry. The user is given an option to upload a picture of their pet, along with a personal gallery where they can store all their pets pictures at. The user is given helpful links for pet resources and, if they're looking to adopt a new pet, they user is given an option for seeing adoptable pets in their area. (TBA.)
